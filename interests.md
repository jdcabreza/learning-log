# Interest Log

This is a log of random things that I either want to learn or am just generally curious about, meant for revisiting later on when I have some free time.

- How does load balancing work? How can I implement load balancing?
- What does Nginx really do? What are reverse proxies?
- What is WSGI? What does Uvicorn and Gunicorn do?
